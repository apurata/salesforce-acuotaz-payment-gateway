# Configuration Guide: SFRA Store (Storefront Reference Architecture)

This guide will help you configure an SFRA store from scratch to develop payment method integrations in Salesforce Commerce Cloud.

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18)
- npm (comes with Node.js, don't use another package manager)
- Git installed
- Access to a Salesforce Commerce Cloud instance
- Business Manager administrator permissions

## üöÄ Configuration Steps

### Step 1: Create Sandbox

Here you must log in with your Business Manager account and create the sandbox. **IMPORTANT: CREDITS ARE CONSUMED FROM THE MOMENT THE SANDBOX IS CREATED**. It's recommended to turn off the sandbox when not in use because it consumes fewer credits.

### Step 2: Get SFRA Source Code

You need to log in at https://github.com/orgs/SalesforceCommerceCloud/sso with your Business Manager account.

```bash
# Clone the official SFRA repository with https
git clone https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/storefront-reference-architecture.git
cd storefront-reference-architecture
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install project dependencies
npm install

# Install sgmf-scripts globally (build tool)
npm install -g sgmf-scripts
```

### Step 4: Configure dw.json File

```bash
# Create configuration file (copy from example)
cp dw.json.example dw.json
```

Edit `dw.json` with your instance data:

```json
{
    "hostname": "your-instance.sandbox.us01.dx.commercecloud.salesforce.com",
    "username": "your-username",
    "password": "your-password",
    "code-version": "version1",
    "activate-code-version": true
}
```

### Step 5: Configure WebDAV and Certificates

```bash
# Install Prophet Debugger (official Salesforce tool)
npm install -g prophet-debugger

# Configure certificates for WebDAV
prophet-debugger --upload-cartridge
```

### Step 6: Compile and Upload Cartridges

```bash
# Compile the project
npm run compile:js
npm run compile:scss

# Upload cartridges to the instance
npm run uploadCartridge
```

### Step 7: Configure Store in Business Manager

#### 7.1 Access Business Manager
```
https://your-instance.sandbox.us01.dx.commercecloud.salesforce.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-Site
```

#### 7.2 Configure Cartridge Path
1. Go to `Administration > Sites > Manage Sites`
2. Select your site (e.g., "RefArch")
3. In the "Settings" tab, find "Cartridge Path"
4. Add: `int_handlerframework:app_storefront_base:lib_productlist`

#### 7.3 Configure Sample Data
1. Go to `Site Development > Import & Export`
2. Import the sample data included in SFRA
3. Files located in: `sites/RefArch/`

### Step 8: Verify Installation

```bash
# Run in development mode
npm run dev

# The store should be available at:
# https://your-instance.sandbox.us01.dx.commercecloud.salesforce.com/s/RefArch/
```
